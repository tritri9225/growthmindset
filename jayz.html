        Shawn Carter went through tough times in his younger years. Growing up surrounded by turmoil, economic inequality, and widespread drug use, Carter recreated himself as Jay-Z, the self-proclaimed "god of rap," according to LA Live. Today, he has become one of the most successful musical artists in history, as well the owner of his own entertainment company, clothing line, record label, and more. 
        Shawn Carter was a shy kid who faced many challenges in his life, but arguably the most traumatic occurred at age 11, when his father Adnis Reeves abandoned the family. Talking to Oprah Winfrey on CNN, Jay-Z explained the intermingled feelings of pain, anger, reclusiveness, and responsibility that weighed him down as he felt pressured to step up and take care of his mom. These father issues haunted Jay-Z for decades, and as Complex points out, this trauma was central to many of the rapper's most popular songs, including "Can't Knock the Hustle" and "This Life Forever."
        Years before the adult Jay-Z would conquer his demons, the 11-year-old Shawn Carter had to handle the real world consequences of his dad's absence. When his older brother Eric became addicted to crack, according to The Guardian, Shawn felt like he needed to support the family, so he went to the streets and started selling the same drug his brother was hooked on. 
        Jay-Z has explained that during these years, everyone around him was using crack. Shawn himself never touched the stuff, not wanting to put a dent in his own supply. Plus, seeing the effects of the crack epidemic on his brother and father must have left an impression, considering how young he was. He sold crack for 14 years, and he says it was only when he got older that he really understood the consequences of drug dealing. At the time, it was just a way to survive, and all the other children were doing it, too. At one point, he felt like his only options were to smoke it or sell it, so he'd chosen the latter.
        When Shawn was only 12, he got a gun at a friend's house and started keeping it on him. One day, Eric stole Shawn's ring — so Shawn shot him right in the shoulder, sending him to the hospital. Eric didn't press charges, and even asked for Shawn to visit him in the hospital the next day. Evidently, Eric felt the shooting had been his fault, and he took the chance to apologize to his little brother for the damage his drug addiction had done to their relationship.
        Shawn was looking for a clean escape from the drugs, shootouts, and poverty of the Marcy Projects, and music became his pathway.
