    Carrey had more than one encounter in his growing years. He found out at a very early age that he had dyslexia which created a barrier for him in school. He struggled to support his mother in her battle with severe depression. And he also had to move to Toronto, Canada in his teen years â€“ living with his family in their Volkswagen camper for the first eight months of their residency. Barriers presented themselves, but Carrey prevailed.
