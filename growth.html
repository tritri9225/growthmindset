    <h3 id="fail" >What is failure?</h3>
    <p>
      Most people fail at some point in their lives. It’s a necessary and fundamental part of life. People have to generally fail at something before they find success – even though failure can be defined as a lack of success, an unsuccessful person, enterprise or thing, a lack or deficiency of a desirable quality. But failure is not a means to an end, nor does failure have to give any indication of permanence. What is permanent is not getting started in the first place out of fear of failure. To fail is to fail to hit one’s target, whatever it may be, but it doesn’t prevent one from trying again. A lot of times, a person fails because they failed to adequately prepare for success. This extends to all aspects of life that people want to improve upon relationships, career-related objectives, and personal achievements. Most people want to a better life, have goals and things they want to do in life. A good deal of time and effort go into preparing for something important – any important undertaking. It seems that many people pursue success half-heartedly, with little effort and preparation, and they wonder why the fail. Preparation is the key to avoiding failure, or it at the very least minimizes one’s chances of failing. But it’s not always a certainty. To lessen the likelihood of failure, one has to do things to maximize their probability of success. This can be changing one’s daily lifestyle habits, for one example. A person focused on accomplishing something, on creating success, will have to dedicate their free time to this cause. This means early nights and even earlier mornings, staying home and working instead of going out and spending money or wasting one’s time. Failure can often be attributed to a lack of commitment to success. Everyone – well, perhaps most people – strive for success. People as a whole don’t strive to fail at things in life. They generally want to excel at them. Lifestyle habits are important when considering their effect on failure, but one’s mental habits are also a key part of success. A person convinced of their success, or that it will assuredly happen in the near future, will most likely be successful in life. They are seeing their success, what it looks and feels like, play out in their minds. This is the start of the Law of Attraction at work. The Law of Attraction is a theory arguing that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, a person can bring about positive or negative results. If a person yearns for success, thinks about it, dreams about it, always has their mind on it, the better their chances will be for them achieving success. This means they will be less likely to fail later. Failure can also be prevented with the right kind of foresight. It is a highly discussed and much-believed notion that a person’s success occurs in direct proportion to their ability to see how everything, every decision that is being made right now, affects their life down the road. People who are prone to failure live mostly for the day, or the next few days, and they neglect to consider the future – even the distant future. This is probably one of the strongest indicators of whether a person will fail or succeed in life. Success – in whatever form – is not an easy thing to come about, to find. Rather it is created from lots of hard work, preparation, persistence and unrelenting confidence. Failure, on the other hand, results from a lack of these things. To conclude, failure is the absence of success, and failure is also not a means to an end, but an opportunity to learn from failure. Everybody fails at some point in their lives. What matters most is moving forward and never giving up on success. It will happen soon enough despite failure.

    <h3 id="set" >What is setback?</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout this life, you will experience a series of disappointments, but bear in mind that no one gets through this life without regret. Some people disappointments are more significant than others, but everyone experiences them, and some deal with failures better than others. Besides, we will encounter disappointments like the death of a loved one, troubled relationships, loss of a job, health challenges, but you must not allow these obstacles to stop you. Your sole purpose in life should be to make sure you overcome anything that life chooses to throw at you. After all, every adversity, troubles, and obstacles in life have a way of strengthening you. Moreover, when you mess up, surround yourself with people who will support you in the ways that you can regroup and tackle what's next. You have GREATNESS within you, and although failure can take a massive emotional toll on your life, you are gaining the perspective that is so needed to handle the inevitable that will arise. Disappointment, failure, and setbacks – everyone experiences these emotional obstacles from time to time, but you cannot lose the sight of you and your values. If you allow yourself to be hindered by these barriers, then it means you don’t have the perception needed to handle setbacks or disappointments. Also, when you bury your head in the sand and refuse to deal with an unpleasant situation, hoping that it will improve or go away, that is what causes your 'setback.' In the end, all that matters is how you handle life’s disappointment as you travel life's journey along the way. And you must be strong enough to stand tall to handle whatever life throws at you, even during the most challenging time where it seems as if life is powerful enough to reach out and slap you straight in the face. You still must be ready to take in the fullness of life and anything it throws at you.

    <h3 id="crit" >What is critique?</h3>
    <p>
      Critique is a method of disciplined, systematic study of a written or oral discourse. Although critique is commonly understood as fault finding and negative judgment, it can also involve merit recognition, and in the philosophical tradition it also means a methodical practice of doubt. The contemporary sense of critique has been largely influenced by the Enlightenment critique of prejudice and authority, which championed the emancipation and autonomy from religious and political authorities.
